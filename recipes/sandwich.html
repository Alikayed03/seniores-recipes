<h2>A chicken sandwich so good you'll never return to popeye's or chick fil a </h2>
<p>Working at a pizza place that served all kinds of pizzas along with sandwiches <strong>and</strong> pastas gave me the opposite dilemma from the <a href="pizza.html">pizza recipe</a></p>
<p>Instead of being unable to decide what I wanted to eat due to limited options, now my problem was I had <strong>too many</strong> options </p>
<p>Even though I am not a picky eater I could not stop myself from having this sandwich for lunch time and time again</p>
<p>It became my comfort food when I was working because I knew whenever I made this sandwich I could rely on it being extremely tasty and satisfying my hunger every time</p>
<p>Below I have included the recipe so you can indulge yourself in this delectable sandwich along with me</p>
