<h2>About</h2>
<p>As a young teen I always wanted a job, I craved the sense of freedom and liberation I believed you got from a job by being able to make your own money and having the oppurtunity to meet new people everyday.
I was quickly met with the harsh reality that a job can grant you these things but it also comes with alot of resposibilites and is not all about making money and feeling like an adult. 
Luckily I was fortunate enough to have a wonderful boss who I can call my uncle that gave me the opportunity to learn and experience the real world while also being granted these freedoms. 
The job that introduced me to all this is a local pizzeria owned and managed by my uncle called Seniore's Pizza.
While working there I was able to learn and try many new and delicious dishes for the first time in my life.
Below I have compiled my favorite three and shared the recipes so you can try them at home for yourself!</p>
